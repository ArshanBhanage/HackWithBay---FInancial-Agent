1. Creating sample CSV data
2. Providing commands to append new facts
3. Demonstrating the streaming workflow

    ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Steps:
    
    1. **Start all services:**
       Terminal 1: python run_server.py
       Terminal 2: python -m app.pathway.facts_runner
       Terminal 3: curl -N http://localhost:7000/violations/stream
    
    2. **Add facts one by one and watch for violations:**
       - Each line added to data/facts.csv should be processed immediately
       - Violations should appear in the SSE stream
       - Check the terminal running the facts runner for processing logs
    
    3. **Verify violation details:**
       - Check out/violations.jsonl for persistent violation log
       - Verify violation summaries and rule IDs
       - Confirm that valid facts don't trigger violations
    
    4. **Test edge cases:**
       - Empty values (should be handled gracefully)
       - Invalid data types (should be skipped with warnings)
       - Multiple rapid additions (should process in order)
